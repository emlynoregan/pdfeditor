PLACEHOLDER: oembed.png (1200x630 pixels)

This file should be replaced with a 1200x630 pixel PNG image for social media previews.
This image appears when the PDF Editor is shared on social media platforms.

Suggested design:
- App name "PDF Editor" prominently displayed
- Brief description like "Fill PDF Forms Online"
- Professional, clean design
- Blue theme color (#2563eb) consistent with the app
- Maybe include a simple mockup of a PDF form being filled

The image should be:
- 1200x630 pixels (required for proper social media display)
- PNG format
- Clear, readable text
- Professional appearance
